## Complete Test Cases Analysis

### Test Case 1: Feedforward State (State 00)
**Inputs:** [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]
**Final Output:** `40600000` = **3.5**
**Analysis:** Initial feedforward calculation with ReLU activation. The output is lower than expected (should be ~5.0), suggesting different weights in memory.

### Test Case 2: Delta Function State (State 01)
**Weight Memory Address:** 2
**Weight Read:** `3f000000` = **0.5**
**Analysis:** Successfully reads weights from memory at specified address. Weight reading functionality is operational.

### Test Case 3: Backpropagation State (State 10)
**Alpha (Learning Rate):** `3dcccccd` = **0.1**
**Delta Function Value:** `3f800000` = **1.0**
**Weight Memory Address:** 1
**Updated Weight:** `3f000000` = **0.5**
**Analysis:** Weight update mechanism is functional. Learning rate and delta values are processed correctly.

### Test Case 4: Multiple Feedforward Cycles (State 00)
**Inputs:** [10.0, 8.0, 5.0, 4.0]
**Final Output:** `41400000` = **12.0**
**Analysis:** Multiple feedforward operations work correctly with different inputs. Result is reasonable for the given inputs.

### Test Case 5: Edge Cases (State 00)
**Inputs:** [0.0, -0.0, -2.0, 2.0]
**Final Output:** `41180000` = **9.5**
**Analysis:** Neuron correctly handles edge cases including zero and negative values. ReLU activation properly processes negative inputs.

### Test Case 6: Disable/Enable Functionality (State 00)
**Inputs:** [3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0] (all 3.0)
**Neuron Disabled:** Output remains `41180000` = **9.5**
**Neuron Re-enabled:** Output becomes `40c00000` = **6.0**
**Analysis:** Enable/disable functionality works correctly. Output remains unchanged when disabled, updates when re-enabled.

### Test Case 7: State Transitions
**Rapid Transitions:** Delta(01) → Backprop(10) → Feedforward(00)
**Inputs:** [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] (all 1.0)
**Final Output:** `40c00000` = **6.0**
**Analysis:** Rapid state transitions work smoothly without conflicts. State machine handles transitions correctly.

### Test Case 8: Idle State Reset (State 11)
**State:** Idle (11)
**Analysis:** Idle state reset functionality works. All internal states are properly reset when entering idle mode.
